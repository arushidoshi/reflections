When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When there are multiple collaborators contributing to your work, it is better
to have a remote repository. Also, when you are going to be performing changes on the
go, it is better to have a machine-independent repository. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It better to pull changes manually rather than having an automatic update
from Git because certain features might be designed by other collaborators as the
remote repository is public and we might not want those changes synced in our current
working directory. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Fork-When you want to use a repository of another person on GitHub then you
fork it to your own account to make a copy of it and personalise the changes.
Clones-When you want to make a copy of the repository locally or copy from your 
account on GitHub to your local machine, then you can clone it. 
Branches-when you make certain changes to the code and would not like to include 
those commits to the master then you make a branch to keep track of them. branches are
made locally.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	If a copy of the last known state of the remote is stored locally then using
that we can compare our local copy with it and perform a git merge on them to make an 
updated local copy. Also, keeping a backup of the remote copy can be useful.
