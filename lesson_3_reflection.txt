When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	When there are multiple collaborators contributing to your work, it is better
to have a remote repository. Also, when you are going to be performing changes on the
go, it is better to have a machine-independent repository. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	It better to pull changes manually rather than having an automatic update

remote repository is public and we might not want those changes synced in our current
working directory.
